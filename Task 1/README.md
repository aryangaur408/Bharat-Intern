# Handwritten Image Recognition

Welcome to my GitHub repository! This project focuses on developing a deep learning model to recognize handwritten images.

## Introduction

In this repository, I present an image recognition model capable of identifying handwritten characters. The project is implemented using Python and popular deep learning libraries.

## Features

- Dataset preprocessing and augmentation
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture
- Model training and evaluation
- Visualization of results
- User interface for testing custom images

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Matplotlib

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/aryangaur408/Bharat-Intern/Task1/Img_RecognitionModel.ibynp`
2. Install the required packages.
3. Explore and run the `jupyer notebook` to understand the model development process.
4. Use the provided scripts to train the model or load a pre-trained one for testing.
